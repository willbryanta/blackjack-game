# How to play BlackJack

The aim of the game is to have a hand that totals higher than the dealer's without totalling 22 or higher. Picture cards are all worth **10 points**. An Ace can either be **1 point or 11 points**. The points for all other cards is taken at **face value**. 

## Playing the game

1. All players bet a specified amount then the dealer deals all players two cards face up, whilst dealing themselves only one card face up. If a player is dealt an Ace and a 10 or picture card (see *Example 1*) then that player is instantly paid out (Blackjack!).

> *Example 1* 
> ![21](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/BlackJack6.jpg/1200px-BlackJack6.jpg) draw two cards which add up to 21 which is called Blackjack.

2. If no one has hit Blackjack, the player(s) can either choose to *split* or *hit*. If Aces are split, you only receive 1 additional card for each Ace. If you split Aces and a 10 or picture card is drawn, the total is 21 *not* Blackjack.

> *Hit*: when you wish the dealer to deal you an additional card.
>> You may opt for this option if your total hand value is well below tenty-one i.e. 13.

3. Once all players have taken their turns, the dealer draws another card for their hand. The dealer must draw until their hand totals 17 or more.

## End of game

The player has three outcomes:

* Player wins
> Player's hand total is closer to 21 than the dealer's
* Player loses
> Dealer's hand total is closer to 21 than the player's
* Player draws with the dealer
> Player and the dealer have the same hand total.

## Payouts

* Blackjack: instant 3/2
* Player win: 2/1
* Player loses: No payout
